Inspired from [IITD Discord Bot](https://github.com/as1605/IITD-Bot)

```
python3 data.py - s <semester>
```

This loads the data for course enrollment and needs to be called once, the semester by default is the current semester

for the first semester in 2023-24 <semester> would be replaced by 2301


```
python3 courses.py -k <kereberos>
```

This shows the courses a student is enrolled in from the data loaded previously
